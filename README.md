# Final Project
for Computational Physics

# Manual
To start please use: <br />
```
python start.py <preset>
```
<br />
For use of custom fluid dynamic applications, please use the following: <br />
```
python start.py custom
```
<br />
The code can take a long time to run the results can be seen in the result folder <br />

# Inspiration
Code Based on Lattice Boltzmann fluid simulation (by Jonathan Viquerat) <br />
