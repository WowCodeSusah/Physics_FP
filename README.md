# Final Project
for Computational Physics

# Manual
To start please use:
```python start.py <preset>```
For use of custom fluid dynamic applications, please use the following: 
```python start.py custom```
The code can take a long time to run the results can be seen in the result folder

# Inspiration
Code Based on Lattice Boltzmann fluid simulation (by Jonathan Viquerat)
